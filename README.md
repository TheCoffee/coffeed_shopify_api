# Getting Started with the Shopify Storefront API andÂ Node.js

Shopify provides a versatile Storefront API that allows us  to access a full range of commerce options. The API makes it possible for customers to view products and collections, add products to a cart, and check out.

This repo is an extension of the Medium article on Coffeed that deals with integrating the Storefront API to a Node.js web app. The project uses express to create the routes to access the API.

## Installing dependencies

Install project dependencies by running:
```bash
yarn
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
node index.js
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the API by modifying `index.js`.
